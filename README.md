ObjCSmalltalkExtensions
=======================

This is a set of useful Objective-c category class extensions for NSString, NSArray and NSMutableArray that adds common Smalltalk methods, eg. collect: for NSArray and NSMutableArray, and match: for NSString. These methods use blocks to perform their tasks. However they are not optimized for large-scale collections. They are intended for convenience and better code readability.

Along with them a set of unit tests are provided (using GHUnit). In order to run them, just run the scheme "SmalltalkExtensionsTests > Iphone 5.0 simulator". Please note that you need to previously download and link GHUnit. 

Have fun!
